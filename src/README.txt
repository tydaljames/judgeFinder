Judge Finder
Tyler D'Alessandro

In a town, there are N people. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge. If the
town judge exists, then:
1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.


How to use:
In the main function, supply the array trust with trust pairs, trust[i] = [a, b]. In each pair, person a trusts person b.
The program will then return the number of the Judge if there is one, and -1 if there is no Judge.
